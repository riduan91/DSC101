    "### 1.4.1 Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Their are two main classes of machine learning problems: **supervised learning** and **unsupervised learning**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Supervised learning** is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs (labeled example). E.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prediction of house price: We know that for any house, the expected outcome should be a reasonable positive number. We also have a set of real houses and their price in the market. These data can be used for training, so the machine will be able to predict new cases in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Classification of spam/non-spam emails: We know that the expected outcome should be a label: spam/non-spam. We already have a set of emails that were correctly classified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning problems, in its turn, can be classified into two main subclasses: **Regression** (when the outcome is a continuous variable) and **Classification** (when the outcome is a discrete variable).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unsupervised machine learning** is the machine learning task of inferring a function to describe hidden structure from \"unlabeled\" data. Since the examples given to the learner are unlabeled, there is no evaluation of the accuracy of the structure that is output by the relevant algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clustering: We have data corresponding to genes of lots of species, and would like to cluster them into groups. Data are not labeled, so we cannot explicitly evaluate the accuracy of our algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, in those problems, for some new data $X$, we would like to predict the outcome $y$ via a function $f$ such that $f(X) \\approx y$. In supervised learning, we have example data under the form $(X, y)$, while in unsupervised learning, we just have $(X)$.\n",
    "\n",
